What is an ArrayBuffer?

An ArrayBuffer is a fixed-length block of memory.
It represents a generic, raw binary data buffer.
You cannot read or write directly to an ArrayBuffer; instead, you use a "view" (like TypedArrays or DataView) to interpret the data.

ArrayBuffers -> Array of bytes.

new ArrayBuffer(10) -> to create a buffer of 10 bytes.

ArrayBuffers are not resizeable by default.

Max Size of array buffer can be 2gb.

js has readAsArrayBuffer method to read binary files.

ArrayBuffers in js are garbage collected.
