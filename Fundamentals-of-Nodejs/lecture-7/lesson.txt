to make any js script as ES6 module we first crate a package.json file and set type to module

{
    "type" : "module"
}

in Es6 modules require, exports, __dirname, __filename will not work

in Es6 modules no local scope will be created , Module scope is actually created , Module scope is not global scope.

-> By default strict mode will be enabled in module system

*Common js doesn't care about extensions.
