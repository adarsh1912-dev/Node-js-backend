Difference between Commonjs and Modules

1 -> common js Modules loads synchronously but in es6 modules it happens asynchronously.

2-> File extenstion is optional in commonjs but not in es6 modules, you must give extension as .js .

3-> Value of this keyword is different 

-- in cjs this points to module.exports object.
-- in mjs this is undefined. 

4-> mjs are hoisted but cjs are not.

5-> in mjs we can use await keyword even outside of a async function but not in cjs.(Top level awai is allowed in mjs but not in cjs).

6-> in cjs only one value can be exported (module.exports) object. But in mjs multiple values can be exported.

7-> Strict mode is not enabled by default in cjs but in mjs strict mode is enabled.
