Types of Streams in Node.js

Node.js provides several types of streams to handle reading and writing data efficiently. Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion.

1. **Readable Streams**
	- Used for reading data.
	- Example: `fs.createReadStream()` for reading files.

2. **Writable Streams**
	- Used for writing data.
	- Example: `fs.createWriteStream()` for writing files.

3. **Duplex Streams**
	- Can be both readable and writable.
	- Example: TCP sockets (`net.Socket`).

4. **Transform Streams**
	- Duplex streams that can modify or transform the data as it is read or written.
	- Example: `zlib.createGzip()` for compressing data.

**Summary Table:**

| Stream Type      | Readable | Writable | Example                  |
|------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| Readable         | Yes      | No       | File read stream         |
| Writable         | No       | Yes      | File write stream        |
| Duplex           | Yes      | Yes      | TCP socket               |
| Transform        | Yes      | Yes      | Gzip compression stream  |

Streams are essential for handling large amounts of data efficiently, such as working with files, network communications, or any scenario where data is processed in chunks.
